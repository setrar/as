* 64 bits distribution:

I couldn't find any suitable distribution for Kali despite going through the official releases on [offensive-security.com](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-arm-images) images

I tried : 
- [ ] [Kali Linux RPi](https://images.kali.org/arm-images/kali-linux-2020.3a-rpi.img.xz) image
- [ ] [Kali Linux RaspberryPi 2 (v1.2), 3 and 4 (64-Bit)](https://images.kali.org/arm-images/kali-linux-2020.3a-rpi3-nexmon-64.img.xz) image
